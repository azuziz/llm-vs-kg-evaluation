Extract biomedical relations between exactly two given nodes.
Return the single most plausible relation based on general biomedical knowledge,
but only if at least one relation is plausibly supported.
If none are plausibly supported, return an empty edges list.
Use only the allowed predicates and only the provided CURIEs.
